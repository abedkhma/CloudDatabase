# Cloud-Based Storage Systems: Course Project

## Overview
This project is part of a hands-on course at TU Munich that focuses on the design, implementation, and evaluation of cloud-based storage systems. The project is divided into two milestones. By the end of the course, we have developed a persistent Key-Value (KV) store, culminating in a final project.

## Course Milestones
- **Milestone 1: Containerization Introduction**  
  Learn the basics of containerization to deploy applications efficiently.
  
- **Milestone 2: Persistent Key-Value Store**  
  Design and develop a single-node persistent KV store.

## Final Project
In the final phase, students will extend the persistent KV store to solve a real-world problem or create a new feature on top of the existing system.
